**SwaggerHub**

SwaggerHub is an integrated API development platform that brings together all the core capabilities of the open source Swagger framework, along with additional advanced capabilities to build, document, manage, and deploy your APIs. 

[Hackney's SwaggerHub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/organizations/Hackney)

## Designing and documenting your API prior to implementation

At Hackney, we believe in working in a collaborative way and this is embedded into our API development process. Before commencing the implementation stage, each API endpoint will first need to be documented using SwaggerHub. The benefits include:
* Open specification standards.
* Opportunity to mock the API and avoid possible blockers for front end development.
* Opportunity to share and reach a common agreement of what the API request and response should look like before any work has commenced.


The documentation aids our collaboration process, as it is shared with the whole team. People, both from technical and non-technical backgrounds, can provide feedback and request changes. This can save hours of development and also ensures that every team member has an understanding of the main question — what will this API do?

SwaggerHub allows us to build an implementation specification, and serves as a documentation of the API we are developing. In this way, developers have clearly defined requirements of how the API endpoint they are working on needs to look — this includes request parameters, response object and error responses.

Additionally, we share the API blueprint with other relevant parties, such as the Product Owner, to confirm that the data, that is part of the request and response of the API, is correct, based on the business area understanding of the wider team and any prior discovery work completed. It is a way of getting everyone from the team to work towards the same, shared goal.

Further details on SwaggerHub and the process of creating swagger docs can be found [here](link to be added).

## API documentation post-deployment

The Base API includes automatic swagger docs generation for each API endpoint added. 

Your API should include a swagger endpoint, publicly accessible, that represents an up-to-date version of your API.
