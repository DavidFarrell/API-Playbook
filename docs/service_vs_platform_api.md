# Service API vs Platform API

## What is a Service API?
Service APIs are used for specific data representation. Service APIs have additional data processing to satisfy a specific service need.
Service APIs can consume the one or more Platform APIs and modify the response object to meet their specific needs (if required).

## What is a Platform API?
Platform APIs are data-driven, domain modelled APIs that expose generic data for re-use for several services of similar datasets. It is a holistic representation of a domain specified. It is the foundation layer for the API ecosystem allowing higher-level APIs access to data sources and hence it is reusable and consistent across.
