### What is AWS DMS?
AWS Data Migration Service (DMS) is a service that allows us to migrate data between a source (in our case, on-premises database) and a target (in our case, Postgres database hosted in AWS).

[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SSz4mOKaLPdF2pBaAO52h1CHFQC8pnGjMt2fIkQ5bEA/edit?usp=sharing) is a Guide to the Data Migration Playbook to explain how the Data migration works.
