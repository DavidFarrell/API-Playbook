## The need of a Developer Hub

As an Organisation we want to ensure that our APIs are modern, easy to access and easy to use. We also want to provide clear documentation, accessible test environments, a simple onboarding process and good quality help and support to our users.
Hackney Council’s aim as an organisation is to make integration easier - for everyone who wants to connect to our platforms and services. Whether you’re already using our APIs, or want to connect for the very first time, The Developer Hub is a way to make that journey easier and faster for all our users.

## To achieve this mission, we are:

- Building an API platform - a one-stop shop for all our APIs, old and new
- Building an exemplar API
- Migrating our other APIs to the platform


## Specifications

The Hackney API Developer Hub will provide information and instructions on:
- What APIs are
- Why might you need an API?
- How to create APIs according to the HackIt API playbook
- What the API platform is
- A list of the available APIs
- API Authentication

## Why might you need an API?
- Sharing your data
- Data integrity
- Integrations - APIs can provide links between different back end systems
