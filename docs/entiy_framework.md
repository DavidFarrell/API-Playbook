## Entity Framework Core 

## Introduction

Entity Framework Core is an object-relational mapper that lets .NET developers work with a database using .NET objects. 

This reduces the amount of data-access code that needs to be written. 

This means that instead of writing code to directly interact with our databases, we can instead create a domain class which identifies the database from which weâ€™re retrieving our data and maps column titles to the properties of that class.
