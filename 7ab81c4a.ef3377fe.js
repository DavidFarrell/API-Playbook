This is particularly useful when front end and back end teams are working on the same project. Often, front end work might get blocked as it has a dependency on an API. Providing a mock API and API blueprints will remove this blocker as it will give the front end developers all the information they need to proceed with their work, while back end developers can focus on developing good, reliable and resilient APIs.
