These iterations were necessary as we grew in clarity over what we felt would be the best set of tools and practices for us as a development team.  Where we discovered we may have got some things wrong or could do with some improvement we worked on making it right.  For example, during the course of our journey we have transitioned from container based services running on EC2 machines to serverless functions.  We also reviewed our methods of authorisations on our APIs and implemented a custom authorisation solution.  We have continued to work with our agency partners to continuously improve our development practices and standards, and the playbook evolved as a result.  Today we have come to the point where our playbook has taken a more governance role and now leads more than it is led, and onboarding as ever been so easy. This also allowed us to justify the ROI on API strategy by bringing consistency and standardization across all APIs developed by internal/external developers for relevant services.
